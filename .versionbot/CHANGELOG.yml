      hash: 70b97121ccd2b3e75b3b3bea00b6bfad18811053
      body: |
        The device sanity checks examined two on-device files, in an attempt
        to prevent HUPs from installing OS versions incompatible with the
        underlying hardware.  It is no longer a useful check, as the script is
        normally invoked directly from the dashboard.

        The immediate prompt for this change is to enable hands-off
        device-type changes for customers with private device types; by
        removing the check, we can patch the device type in the API, and leave
        OS upgrades to the customer.

      body: |
        In order to detect issues with deltas and work around them with a
        regular pull, we need `hostapp-update` to fail and propagate that back
        to our caller. By splitting out these post-update steps into a different
        function, we can `&&` them together and restore the previous behavior.

      body: |
        currently there are occasions when a supervisor upgrade does not
        complete before the HUP reboots a device. this causes confusion when the
        supervisor eventually does update 15 minutes after boot.

      hash: 2fea51041794e175ec1f28874b100dbe3868530b
      body: >
        Recently the supervisor added a codepath that assumes no files
        underneath it will change during runtime.

        OS update hooks can trigger a condition whereby the supervisor reboots
        the device during a HUP,

        which in turn bricks the device. As a workaround, we can use a transient

        unit to ensure that the remote-executed update does not occur alongside

        the locally-executed update.

      body: |-
        Previously we might have logged when there wasn't any logfile setup,
        for example if any of the argument parsing was throwing an error,
        and on the 2.x updater there wasn't any way to directly know what
        the error was, just that the update didn't start.
        Moving the logfile setup before any logging takes place eliminates
        this issue. The flag was also only really used in manual HUP runs
        (no way to use in self-serve updates), and it's more relevant to
        1.x updates than anything since.

        user

        application might be taking too much of the resources.

        Increase this x10, 0.2s*1500=300s=5min, which is still quite short, and

        definitely shorter than if the user needs to ask support and retry
        because

        of "spurious" timeouts. Valid errors should be still caught quite
        quickly.

        * make the hotpatch-related architecture check automatic, and do it when
        it is needed
        * only do device type support check if the update version is not to a
        hostapp-enabled version
        * make it clearer that the device support check is needed to know how
        to switch the boot partition on those OS versions (when it's not
        the hostapp update hooks that do that)
        * deprecate the `--assume-supported` flag, as it has no meaning
        now, practically

        Using temp files instead of fixed file name on the host OS
        side fixes an issue when the update has been interrupted, but
        the OS hasn't been restarted before the next update attempt. In that
        case repeated `mkfifo` would fail with the same filename. Instead
        of reusing the filename, properly use a tempfile that is not
        clashing. Thus if the update fails, it can be safely restarted
        (and a new filename would be used).

        The previous way didn't work with `overlay2` storage drivers, as the
        directory structure is different.
        Also, for more correctness, restart the `balena-host` service after
        the cleanup so it would have proper information after the deletes.
        Without this `overlay2` cleanup doesn't work, and should be proper
        for the `aufs` drivers too.

        In the partition copy step, first we switch partitions to read-only,

        the comparison afterwards fails, but if running the same `dd ...` line

        again, then succeeds.

        The current theory is that the `dd` starts too soon before all data

        was written to disk after switching to read-only. Experimentally

        I don't hit the integrity check fail again (tested on multiple devices

        that exhibited that error).

        The symptom-tracking issue is #186.

        When stopping the supervisor service and container,
        also remove the container, so next time when it starts
        up it will be recreated.
        This might be important for updates, as there could be a
        race condition, the new supervisor starting up on the old
        system, and if the container is just stopped, when rebooting
        the restart will carry over strange states.
        This possibly fixes issues when a lockfile is detected by
        the supervisor, but it might be just from an earlier
        run of supervisor that was stopped at the right time.
        If no container, no data is carried over.

        We have some resinOS 1.x versions that have backported, logstream
        enabled supervisors. The updater checks the `VERSION` file online
        to see what supervisor version to update to. Previously the version
        in that file was `a.b.c-shortsha`, and we've thrown away anything
        after the dash. In this case we have to communicate that it's a
        logstream supervisor, and the cleanest is storing `a.b.c-logstream`
        in that file. The updater with this change turns that version into
        a supervisor tag, `va.b.c_logstream` ultimately, while backwards
        compatible with non-logstream versions online (as long as they
        are available).

        Balena migration requires moving the existing docker folder
        (used by docker-host) to the new balena folder. In some
        cases that migration wasn't done properly, as somehow
        there was a balena folder already, and the previous logic
        didn't clear that up. This resulted in inability of update
        as the partition runs out of space.
        Example is 2.7.5->2.7.8->anything above 2.9.0. The second
        step did not succeed.
        The modified cleanup handles handles migration more robustly.

        For an ongoing issue with ARMv6 devices downloading multilayer images
        from Docker HUB, we need to switch docker to not run parallel
        downloads. The option used for that is only available for resinOS
        versions 2.0.7+ and versions below 2.5.0 are affeccted. Thus only
        cover those versions with the immediate fix, which is mainly needed
        for the supervisor update only.
        For `raspberry-pi` device type (the only one affected) on resinOS
        versions <2.0.7, the supervisor update will not succeed in the pull
        step, but the device will self-recover ~15 minutes after reboot, when
        repulling the supervisor by the regular scheduled supervisor updater.
        This inconvenience is a tradeoff, as we don't know any other workaround
        for this issue yet.

        This would bunch the changes closer to each other, thus the irreversible
        changes are closer to each other in the execution, as well as if the
        supervisor update fails, then the device will be in a reversible
        state (no permanent changes should have been made).

        Previously the entries called with "log ..." were part of the logfile

        created (defined by $LOGFILE), but that was missing the output (both

        normal and errors) for the commands called in the script.

        Doing these changes, all the output will be put in the logfile on the

        device, with the downside, that over SSH there's no copy. To receive
        logs

        over SSH, have to call with --no-log (then no logfile, but log on

        standar output). This is different behaviour than before, but should

        improve logs for when the scripts are called over the proxy (when

        only the on-device logs matter)

        Move from Debian to Alpine base image for resinHUP, which saves
        considerable space.
        This change also moves all the resinHUP parts into their own folder
        to reduce files added into the Docker container. No code change
        in the Python section.

      body: >-
        This patch fixes two issues on boards running rce:

        1. As rce is actually docker 1.4.3 it can't pull from docker registry
        (v2). As

        well we know that we did the migrate from rce to docker in 1.5.0 so, if
        we

        update a device with rce, make sure it tries to get the update from our

        internal registry (v1) and not from dockerhub.

        2. rce uses rce.sock so if there is no docker.sock, try rce.sock.

      body: >-
        In some cases there is needed for the update to come with an overlay fs

        structure which is intended to be written on top of new rootfs after
        update.

        This overlay FHS needs to be in a directory called quirks and located in
        the

        root of the update files structure.

        Use case example: docker shadows resolv.conf so we need to provide it in

        another location which would used to copy it in the final rootfs.
